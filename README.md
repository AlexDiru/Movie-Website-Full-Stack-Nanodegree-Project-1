# Movie Website Full Stack Nanodegree Project 1

![Screenshot of HTML page](Screenshot.png?raw=true)

Source code for a Movie Trailer website. Forked from https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode

PEP8 style followed, except for URLs (they make the lines too long and I'd rather not break the URLs by concatenating two strings)

Changes from forked version
- Added three movies
- Error handling in Movie constructor
- Style changes in fresh_tomatoes.py

How to build
- Clone repo
- ```python entertainment_centre.py```
- This will create fresh_tomatoes.html and display it in a web browser
